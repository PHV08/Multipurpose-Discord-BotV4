# Installation Guide üî•

## ‚úÖ Hosting Requirements

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

  * [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) version 16.6 or higher, I recommend the latest STABLE version
  * [python](https://python.org) version 3.8 or higher, to install the database `enmap` (better-sqlite3)
  * A VPS would be advised, so you don't need to keep your PC/laptop/RasPi 24/7 online! [Click here for a debian setup](https://github.com/Tomato6966/Debian-Cheat-Sheet-Setup/wiki/).

## ü§ñ Configuration and Starting

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

  **NOTE:** *You can do the exact same configuration inside of the `example.env` file, just make sure to rename it to `.env` or use environment variables!*
 
   1. Check `üé∂ Music Requirements` that you started lavalink / use a valid public lavalink station.
   2. Fill in all required data in `./botconfig/config.json` **NOTE:** *If you're on replit.com, it is exposed to everyone!(use .env instead)*
   3. Fill in all required data in the `.json` files in `./social_log/` (`./social_log/streamconfig.json` & `./social_log/twitter.json`), if you want the SOCIAL LOGS to work! (the key `authToken` in streamconfig does not need to be filled in!)
   4. You can adjust some settings in the other `./botconfig/*.json` Files, **BUT PLEASE __KEEP__ MY CREDITS & ADS!** This is the only way on how my hard work is "revenued".
   5. Now start the bot by opening a cmd line in that folder and typing: `node index.js` or `npm start`
     * If you don't want to keep the terminal open or if you're on linux, check out [pm2 (and my tutorial)](https://github.com/Tomato6966/Debian-Cheat-Sheet-Setup/wiki/4-pm2-tutorial) and type: `pm2 start --name Bot_Name index.js`
